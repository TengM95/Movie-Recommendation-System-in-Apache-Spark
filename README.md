# Movie Recommendation System in Apache Spark

In this project, we will use an Alternating Least Squares (ALS) algorithm to predict the ratings for the movies in [MovieLens small dataset](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/latest/).

Did Data ETL and Data Exploration on 1GB MovieLens movie rating dataset using Spark SQL and Spark Dataframe.  

Implemented Alternating Least Square (ALS) model using Spark.MLlib to achieve a movie recommendation system.    

Tuned the hyper-parameters of ALS based on Spark RDD and learned the latent factors of users and items.     

Based on the recommendation system, recommended personalized movies for user and analyzed underlying factors.
